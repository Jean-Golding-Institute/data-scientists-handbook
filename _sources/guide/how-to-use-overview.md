# How to use the `Our Handbook` template

Thank you for taking this opportunity to create a considered and healthy research culture with your group.

`Our Handbook` is a [Jupyter Book](http://jupyterbook.org/) template for a research group handbook. 
Group leaders and members edit the book together to create a living document which works for them, by following the steps below. 
`Our Handbook` has a variety of different sections, your group might not use all of them, and each section has a variety of solutions that you can choose from.

## 1\. Make your own copy this repo
* Fork the repo (if your group doesn't have a GitHub organisation, perhaps make one and fork to there).
* Make all members of your team collaborators of the forked repo

## 2\. Edit the book with your team
* Clone the forked repo locally
* Set up an away day, a hack day, or a series of team meetings where you edit the book together - detailed suggestions and guidance for what to edit and how to run the sessions [here](editing-guide.md)!
<!-- TODO: Make a guide to handbook hack days: preparations for organisers, instructions for members, etc, i.e. install VS code, add jupyterbook plugin, etc - and link here  see our [guide to handbook hack days](hack-day.md)-->

## 3\. Make your handbook available online
<!-- TODO: add link below-->
* Follow the instructions [here]() to make your handbook available online.
* Make sure that you link to the handbook on your group website, and in any job (including PhD studentship) openings.
* Please tell us if you use this handbook! 

### 4\. Keep the book updated
#### 4A. Onboard new team members using the handbook when they join
* Show them around the handbook and the current expectations for group members.
* Show them how to edit the handbook, and ask them to edit themselves in to the team members section (using the instructions for new members page).

#### 4B. Review the book 
* Review the book as a team regularly (we suggest once per year). Set aside a session at an away day or a team meeting to do this. This is an opportunity for the team to share new expertise that they've learned in the last year, and to decide as a group to adapt new group-wide policies or processes.
* Review the book with team members individually (we suggest every 6 months for new staff, or once per year for others). This is an opportunity to check that the groups research culture is working for everyone.
